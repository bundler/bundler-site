documented, tested, and built for use across different dependency managers built in Ruby.

## Improved gemspec detection

Directories are now searched resursively for gemspecs, with specs found closer to the root being preferred.

## Other changes

Bundler 1.9 also includes:

- improved vendoring of `thor` that will make conflicts less common
- fixed gemspecs generated by `bundle gem` from a pre-release bundler version
- `bundle which` will no longer be confused by directories
