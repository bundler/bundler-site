  %h1 The Best Way to Manage Your Application's Dependencies.

  %p.lead
    Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking
    and installing the exact version of gems that are needed.

  %p.lead
    Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems
    you need are present in development, staging, and production.

    %a.btn.btn-default.btn-block(href="/doc/rationale") Why Bundler exists

%h2#getting-started Getting Started

%p
  Getting started with bundler is easy! Open a terminal window and run this command:

  :code
    $ gem install bundler
%p
  Specify your dependencies in a Gemfile in your project's root:

  :code
    # lang: ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    gem 'nokogiri'
    gem 'rack', '~>1.1'
    gem 'rspec', :require => 'spec'
  .buttons
    = link_to 'Learn More: Gemfiles', '/doc/gemfile.html'

%p
  Install all of the required gems from your specified sources:

  :code
    $ bundle install
    $ git add Gemfile Gemfile.lock
  .btn.btn-default
    = link_to 'Learn More: bundle install', '/doc/bundle_install.html'

.alert.alert-info
  %p
    The second command adds the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock to your repository.
    This ensures that other developers on your app, as well as your deployment
    environment, will all use the same third-party code that you are using now.


%p
  Inside your app, load up the bundled environment:

  :code
    # lang: ruby
    require 'rubygems'
    require 'bundler/setup'

    # require your gems as usual
    require 'nokogiri'
  .btn.btn-default
    = link_to 'Learn More: Bundler.setup', '/doc/bundler_setup.html'


%p
  Run an executable that comes with a gem in your bundle:

  :code
    $ bundle exec rspec spec/models
.alert.alert-info

  %p
    In some cases, running executables without <code>bundle exec</code>
    may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system
    and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.

  %p
    However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain.
    Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or
    on another machine.

%p
  Finally, if you want a way to get a shortcut to gems in your bundle:

  :code
    $ bundle install --binstubs
    $ bin/rspec spec/models
.alert.alert-info
  %p
    The executables installed into <code>bin</code> are scoped to the
    bundle, and will always work.
