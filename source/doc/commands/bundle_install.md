## bundle install

> Makes sure all the dependencies in your `Gemfile` are available to your application.

~~~
$ bundle install [--binstubs=PATH] [--clean] [--deployment] [--frozen]
                 [--full-index] [--gemfile=FILE] [--local] [--no-cache]

**Options:**

`--binstubs`: Generate binstubs for bundled gems to `./bin`.

`--clean`: Runs bundle clean automatically after install.

`--deployment`: Install using defaults tuned for deployment environments.

`--force`: Force download every gem, even if the required versions are available locally.

`--frozen`: Do not allow the `Gemfile.lock` to be updated after this install.

`--full-index`: Use the rubygems modern index instead of the API endpoint.

`--gemfile`: Use the specified gemfile instead of the default `Gemfile`

`--jobs`: Install gems using parallel workers.

`--local`: Do not attempt to fetch gems remotely and use the gem cache instead.

`--no-cache`: Don't update the existing gem cache.

`--no-prune`: Don't remove stale gems from the cache.

`--path`: Specify a different path than the system default `($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME)`.
Bundler will remember this value for future installs on this machine.

`--quiet`: Only output warnings and errors.

`--retry`: Retry network and git requests that have failed.

`--shebang`: Specify a different shebang executable name than the default (usually 'ruby').

`--standalone`: Make a bundle that can work without the Bundler runtime.

`--system`: Install to the system location `($BUNDLE_PATH or $GEM_HOME)` even if
the bundle was previously installed somewhere else for this application.

`--trust-policy`: Sets level of security when dealing with signed gems. Accepts
'LowSecurity', 'MediumSecurity' and 'HighSecurity' as values.

`--without`: Exclude gems that are part of the specified named group.

  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Gems will be installed to your default system location for
    gems. If your system gems are stored in a root-owned location (such as in
    Mac OSX), bundle will ask for your root password to install them there.
  </p>
  <p>
    While installing gems, Bundler will check <code>vendor/cache</code> and the
    your system's gems. If a gem isn't cached or installed, Bundler will try to
    install it from the sources you have declared in your <code>Gemfile</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>--system</code> option is the default. Pass it to switch back
    after using the <code>--path</code> option as described below.
  </p>
</aside>

Install your dependencies, even gems that are already installed to your system
gems, to a location other than your system's gem repository. In this case,
install them to `vendor/bundle`.

~~~
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
~~~

<aside class="notes">
  Further <code>bundle</code> commands or calls to <code>Bundler.setup</code> or
  <code>Bundler.require</code> will remember this location.

Install all dependencies except those in groups that are explicitly excluded.

~~~
$ bundle install --without development test`
~~~

Install all dependencies on to a production server. Do **not** use this flag on
a development machine.

~~~
$ bundle install --deployment
~~~

The `--deployment` flag activates a number of deployment-friendly conventions:

- Isolate all gems into `vendor/bundle`
- Require an up-to-date `Gemfile.lock`
- If `bundle package` was run, do not fetch gems from rubygems.org. Instead,
only use gems in the checked in `vendor/cache`.

Install gems in parallel by starting the number of workers specified.

~~~
$ bundle install --jobs 4
~~~

Retry failed network or git requests.

~~~
$ bundle install --retry 3
